monowole.2.a;Well, since it is yours by right...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.3;The barracks are decrepit!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.3.desc;[GetTitle], it is absurd the state in which I find the barracks! The former quartermaster neglected it so much it brings shame to me not being able to properly train the men!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.4.b;Take the free workers on sundays and holidays.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.4.c;I'm sure the builder  made it to stand at least another 3 generations...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.4.d;Take the money, hire a master builder and rebuild the towers and walls.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5;Bandits on southern entrance;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5.desc;[GetTitledName], the southern exit of the town is infested with bandits, the guild of merchants has already made petitions and even hired some mercenaries, but with the current state of affairs it had no avail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5.a;Take some of the guards and warriors and kill them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5.b;Hire more men, take the guards and deal with it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5.c;Tell the merchants to use another gate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.5.d;They'll disband soon, I'm sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6;The boring man;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.desc.1;... And then, the brother of the baker told me it would nor work at all, so I told the lady from before that I found a new one... What do you think?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.desc.2;... And then, the man from the carriage tried to actually raise the wheel. RAISE. THE. WHEEL. Can you believe that?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.desc.3;... Again, and I said I liked it, and she asked again why didn't I like it, and I said again that I liked it...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.desc.4;... The moon was so dark then, and I saw none of the swordsmen at my side, and the wife... Oh, the wife! You won't believe what she said to me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.desc.5;...[GetHighGodName] ! She said, and I said you can't speak [GetHighGodName]'s name in vain, but [GetHighGodName] she cried again and I couldn't take it anymore, the coin purse was so light I actually felt kind of, like, free, you know? But the...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.a;I'm sorry, what?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
desc = monowole.6.b.desc.1;What did the peasant say you did? Exploited the workers?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
desc = monowole.6.b.desc.2;What about the man with the strange clothes that was run down by a horseman?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
desc = monowole.6.b.desc.3;Knights of what? Did they hold you up?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
desc = monowole.6.b.desc.4;No wonder, the guard of the bridge must have been a great hero.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.6.b;So, who ruined the wedding, exactly?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.c;Yes, yes, whatever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.6.d;Are you some sort of imbecile?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7;The strange marriage;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7.desc;[GetTitledName], I ask your permission to marry a common serf that lived with my family all her life. She was born a year later after I brought her mother to my lands from a raid about 12 years ago.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7.a;Yes, you have permission.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7.b;I'll grant you permission, so long as you pay me the dowry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7.c;Wait... No.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.7.d;Your lands... No! NO! You disgusting ANIMAL! You filth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8;Too much stress and drink;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8.desc;After countless hours of hearing supplicants, your bottom hurts, your head aches, your eyes are blood-red with dryness, you see you've emptied at least two kegs of wine alone...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8.a;It's the only way to cope...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8.b;[GetHighGodName], kill me...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8.c;It was duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.8.d;And tomorrow, again?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9;The man who speaks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9.desc;That man has been standing and speaking for at least an hour. It seems important, but... ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9.a;This fly has actually landed on all the heads of this court, amazing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9.b;Excuse me, but this wart on your forehead, since when do you have it?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9.c;I'm sorry, the herd was led by whom?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.9.d;Yes, yes, do what you want, just stop speaking.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10;Screaming in the courtyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10.desc;The last supplicant of today bowed, you start to feel the tension lifting up, your shoulders relax and you sit back for a moment before standing up after a particularly long day. Suddenly you hear screaming outside, you, some guards and courtiers rush to see what's the fuss about. Two women, beating down a man, both seem pregnant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10.a;Hah! Ladies, you do amuse me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10.b;What sort of debauchery is this?!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10.c;I will not have chaos on my rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.10.d;Enough, please, there's no need for that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11;The jewish king's decision;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11.desc;Two women come to the court, one smearing the other, flaying their arms around. Both claim to be the mother of a child, and they claim the father was one of your warriors. A guard presents the child to you. One of the women strike a semblance with the child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11.a;It does look like the father, indeed, the mother is clearly the other one.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11.b;It looks too much like the woman to be coincidence, it's clearly hers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11.c;Let them solve it themselves, it's their problem, not mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.11.d;Have you heard of King Solomon? A jewish king from ancient times... He solved such a case in a nice way...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12;The poor are hungry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12.desc;[GetTitledName], liege, last season was too severe on the southern provinces and the merchants are raising the prices to absurd extents and many are starving. I humbly ask of you to donate some of your riches for us to help feed the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12.a;Of course, help them in any way you can!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12.b;I can spare some money. It should suffice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12.c;We cannot spare the resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.12.d;LET THEM STARVE, ITLL MAKE THEM STRONGER;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13;Some new ideas for health;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.desc.1;My [GetTitle], being a philosopher and physician I manage to spend enough time exploring new possibilities. These latest years I have been grooming an interesting idea for us to implement and to better treat some sorts of diseases, and better ways for the physicians cover the expenses and a sort of default price table for physicians to charge from customers, it would make treatment of said diseases more accessible to the poorest. ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.desc.2;[GetTitledName], last week I came from a very far away land, and there, their physicians use herbs and tea to treat wounds instead of spitting on them, very strange indeed. I managed to bring a lot of these herbs and would like to start teaching other physicians like myself to use such treatments.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.desc.3;[GetTitle], I have researched much about the subject of humours and diseases, and my research has led me to believe that great cities have more chance of having outbreaks of illnesses. Therefore I offer the suggestion that you train and bring more physicians to the biggest cities so that when an outbreak happens, we are more prepared.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.a;Well, I can help you for this season.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.b;Yes, brilliant idea! I will spare no expense, the populace deserves it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.c;This is a ludicrous idea, I deny your request.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.13.d;What, there's money to be made on this?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
# monowole.14;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

# monowole.14.d;;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.15;Give away the leftovers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.15.desc;My [GetTitle], I honestly believe that you could show how great your rule is by giving away the leftovers of your banquets and dinners to the hungry and poor. I believe it would be a generous action that would please [GetHighGodName] and also please the populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.15.a;Yes, it sounds good, let everyone know my generosity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.15.b;No, the cats, dogs and pigs are fed with those.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.15.c;No, absolutely not, this is ludicrous. Don't bother me with this again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16;Pissy neighbour;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16.desc;My [GetTItle], my neighbour has asked me for a loan last spring, and he still hasn't paid it. Now he flaunts his well-being and I am left to my ruin, he won't even speak to me! I demand him to be arrested and executed!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16.a;So, you say you loaned him the money, did any of you seal the deal or have witnesses?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16.b;Your demand seems fair and evidence seems sufficient. Arrest that man.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16.c;I cannot decide that, bring him here for a fair trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16.d;You are taking up my precious time, I will arrest you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1;The neighbour trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1.desc;After hearing both sides, it is true that the petitioner loaned the money, but the neighbour gave him back a cow and two goats, one male and female. It seems that the petitioner wanted actual money, but did not refuse the animals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1.a;Arrest the petitioner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1.b;Arrest the neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1.c;Arrest both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-1.d;Arrest no one and stipulate a fine to be paid to the accused by the petitioner and to the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2;The neighbour trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2.desc;After much squirming and gnashing of teeth, you conclude that the neighbour's wife had given him the money back with interest by the end of last season, and apparently the petitioner wanted to take the land from the neighbour if he was to be arrested.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2.a;Arrest the petitioner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2.b;Arrest the neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2.c;Arrest both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-2.d;Arrest no one and stipulate a heavy fine to be paid to the accused by the petitioner and to the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3;The neighbour trial;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3.desc;The trial was longer than expected, there was screaming and threats thrown every time. But after hearing the whole story, it becomes clear to you that the claimant was right, and the neighbour had not even intended to pay back the loan.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3.a;Arrest the petitioner.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3.b;Arrest the neighbour.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3.c;Arrest both.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.16-3.d;Arrest no one and stipulate a heavy fine to be paid to the petitioner by the accused and to the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.17;My brother and my wife betrayed me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.17.desc;[GetTitle], after my last expedition with the army, I came back to my home, with what little I could pillage, I see my wife is with child, at first I thought a miracle, or maybe the expedition was shorter than I thought. When the child was born I was content, but after time went by I started to think, and every day I saw the resemblance of my brother on that child, I remembered he did not leave his lands to fight, he stayed. It was not long before I understood what had happened...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.17.a;This is really not the concern of the court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.17.b;I cannot abide this, I grant you permission kill the brother and the wife! And the child too, if you want.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.17.c;No wonder, you're not man enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18;The duel of cousins;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18.desc;My [GetTitle], after some heavy night of drinking and brawling, I have offended my cousin and he challenged me to a duel! I'm not a fighter, I can't even hold an axe properly! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18.a;I forbid this kind of behaviour! I need the men to fight the enemy, not themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18.b;I see, and I will save you from the duel... In the dungeons you'll be very safe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18.c;If you grant me some of your land and monies, I will provide you with the best armor and shield.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18.d;A duel? I want to watch it!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18-1;The duel takes place;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18-1.desc.1;The two armored men circle each other, one points to the other and shouts every few paces. Both seem nervous, they're agitated. When suddenly one of them charges with the shield, the other is caught off-guard and stumbles down, but the one standing hesitates after raising the sword for a blow. The fallen man kicks him, roll belly down and quickly get up and jumps forward. They both seem very tired now. The other charges once more with the shield, but now the man holds his ground. They clash swords but their hands seem feeble now and drop the weapons, they begin bashing each other's shield and screaming. They drop their shields, take off the helms and start kissing each other, the woman is screaming hysterically. It's a draw and the woman takes a knife and tries to stab them both they hold her down and take her away together.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18-1.desc.2;After banging their swords in respect, the men violently start kicking each other. Each kick takes the balance off of both. They seem enraged and start hacking at each other with the swords. It is not long before one of them starts getting tired and misses the timing to defend with the shield. Blood is splattered all around, the shield-arm of one of them is useless now, but his right arm is still good and drops the shield. The wounded man parries every attack the other makes and eventually finds an opening and strikes at the leg, once more, blood is splattered all over. The woman is screaming and both men cannot continue for long, they are bleeding out and becoming weak. They slash at each otter to no avail and their tiredness becomes more apparent. One of them drops to his knees, but quickly tries to get up, the other takes the chance but lacks strength and both come down rolling. Some punches followed but eventually, both stopped, rolled to their sides and gave up. It's a draw.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18-1.desc.3;As soon as one of them raises his shield, the other comes violently kicking and slashing at it, trying to break the shield, the mand cannot do anything but defend. Suddenly he gets the timing right and bashes the shield right into the attackers opening and hits him in the mouth and throws him back. The man spits out blood and something that looks like a few teeth, brushes the mouth with the sword-arm and screams. The other takes the oportunity to slash at his head, but misses when the screaming man dodges down and use this chance to strike at the attacker's torso. The sword comes out bloody from slashing his sides. The wounded man drops his sword and shield, takes off the helm and accepts defeat. The winner stands and points the sword at his neck, turns it and throws it into the ground, he kneels down and hugs the other man, the woman comes hurrying and the three start kissing each other, somehow someone of them is already taking the woman's clothes off and her top is bare, they then remember there's people watching, and they help each other and go away.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.18-1.a;Interesting turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.19;Marriage request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.19.desc.1;My [GetTitle], I love a woman and she loves me back, I would like your permission to marry her and be able to have my own children.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.19.desc.2;[GetTitledName] this is the most happy time of my life, I have found true love with my neighbour, I want to marry her and make it known that I am hers and she is mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.20;Marriage request;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.22-1.a;Excellent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.23;Treachery!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.23.desc.1;The petitioner stops speaking, his eyes are reddening remarkably quickly, you feel something is wrong. Clearly, the petitioner was enraged by your reaction or that of the courtieris, or maybe he simply hates life and want to die. You see him unsheating his sword and lunging at you, hatred boiling in his eyes and you feel the world slow down around you...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

monowole.23-1;That was close!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.23-1.desc.1;The assassin lunged so quickly at you you barely had the time to react, but your hand was already at your sword and before it was completely off its sheathe, you managed to hold and block their attack. But befor you know it, he slashed again, but you managed to parry this attack.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monowole.23-1.desc.2;The assassin darted at you so quickly you barely had the time to react, fortunately you were already readying yourself, so you managed to block with the sword half-sheathed.

monowole.23-1.desc.3;The assassin came at you quick, but not enough. You unsheathed your sword and as their attack was about to land you parried it and slided your sword through their weapon and used the pommel to hit them in the face.
